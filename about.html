        <!-- Mission -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We are dedicated to providing hospitals and clinics with a comprehensive, reliable, and secure healthcare
                management system that transforms the way care is delivered. Our mission is to simplify complex
                administrative tasks, reduce manual paperwork,
                and streamline hospital operations so that healthcare professionals can focus on their core
                responsibility—delivering high-quality treatment to patients.</p>
            <p>
                We believe technology should enhance, not complicate, healthcare. That is why HMS is designed with a
                user-friendly interface, strong data security, and robust integration capabilities. By consolidating
                critical operations such as patient records, billing,
                appointments, inventory, and supplier management into a single platform, we enable hospitals to reduce
                redundancy, minimize errors, and maintain consistent, accurate information across departments.</p>
            <p>
                We strive to improve communication and collaboration between healthcare providers, staff, and patients.
                By offering real-time data access, secure sharing, and automated reporting, HMS ensures that
                decision-making is faster, better informed, and supported
                by reliable insights. Our goal is to empower medical teams with the tools they need to deliver
                patient-centered care more efficiently.</p>
            <p>
                We are committed to continuous improvement, regularly updating our system with new features, security
                enhancements, and innovative technologies such as telemedicine integration and analytics-driven
                insights. By staying aligned with global healthcare standards
                and compliance requirements, HMS not only protects sensitive patient data but also supports hospitals in
                meeting regulatory obligations.</p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, our mission is to create technology that drives efficiency, builds trust, and enhances the
                overall healthcare experience. We envision a future where hospitals can operate seamlessly, patients
                receive timely and coordinated care, and healthcare
                providers are supported by a platform that evolves with their needs. Through innovation and dedication,
                we aim to be a trusted partner in transforming healthcare management.</p>

        <!-- Vision -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision a future where healthcare is fully digital, inclusive, and transparent, enabling hospitals,
                clinics, and care providers of all sizes to deliver faster, safer, and more effective services. Our
                vision is centered on supporting the
                digital transformation of the healthcare sector through innovative, scalable, and secure technologies
                that simplify operations while improving accuracy, accessibility, and patient satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
                We aim to bridge the gap between technology and compassionate care by building systems that work
                seamlessly in real-world healthcare environments. HMS is designed to empower doctors, nurses,
                administrators, and suppliers with integrated tools that reduce
                complexity, streamline workflows, and improve decision-making. By connecting appointments, patient
                records, billing, inventory, and compliance management into a unified platform, we create an ecosystem
                where collaboration and communication
                are effortless.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe every patient deserves timely treatment, clear information, and coordinated care. Our vision
                extends beyond efficiency; it focuses on creating a transparent and patient-centered experience where
                healthcare professionals are equipped with the
                right data at the right time. By making information flow securely and seamlessly, we reduce delays,
                minimize errors, and support better medical outcomes.</p>
            <p>
                We are committed to driving innovation by adopting advancements such as telemedicine, AI-driven
                diagnostics, mobile accessibility, and predictive analytics. These technologies will ensure that
                healthcare remains adaptive to the needs of both providers
                and patients in a rapidly changing world.</p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, our vision is to create a healthcare environment where technology enhances human connection
                rather than replacing it. By combining digital transformation with empathy, we strive to deliver
                solutions that not only strengthen hospital operations
                but also improve the quality of life for patients and communities everywhere. Through this vision, HMS
                seeks to redefine the future of healthcare management.
